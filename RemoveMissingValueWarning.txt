#ggplot2 subscribes to the philosophy that missing values should never go missing
#ggplot2 does not include them in the plot but does warn that they have been removed:
ggplot(data = diamonds2, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
#to remove the warning, set na.rm = TRUE
ggplot(data = diamonds2, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
